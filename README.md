The code in this branch is a prototype of HotStuff with an asynchronous fallback. It supplements the paper [Jolteon and Ditto: Network-Adaptive Efficient Consensus with Asynchronous Fallback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10362) and there are no plans to maintain this branch. All data points used to produce the graphs of the paper are available in the folder [hotstuff/data](https://github.com/asonnino/hotstuff/tree/async/data).
