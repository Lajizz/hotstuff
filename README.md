The code in this branch is a prototype of HotStuff with a leader election scheme based on *node's reputation*. It supplements the paper ['Be Aware of your Leaders']() and there are no plans to maintain this branch. All data points used to produce the graphs of the paper are available in the folder [hotstuff/data](data/).
